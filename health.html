    Through the use of structured experiences, group discussions and interactions, this dynamic, engaging and interactive session is designed to provide participants with the opportunity to increase their awareness of mental health and its potential incidence and impact in the workplace,
     challenge existing stereotypes of mental illness, and explore how they might better support their colleagues who are struggling with mental health issues.
      Additionally, participants will have an opportunity to consider their current mental health and strategies to ensure continued health and well-being in their current context.
