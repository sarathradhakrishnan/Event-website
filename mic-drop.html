Times Mic Drop with Shankar Ehsaan Loy is the most awaited digital concert of 2021!

For more than two decades now, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have given us the most memorable music. The trio is one of the finest music combos of all time, creating music that spans classical and modern, jazz and contemporary, Hindustani and rock, old or new. Be it the most famous music track of Kal Ho Na Ho, or the young and relatable music of Dil Chahta Hai — Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy never failed to intensify every emotion we felt while watching movies. It’s time to revisit the nostalgia, come join us for a musical evening by the magical trio itself. Catch them live on 23rd June, 2021.
